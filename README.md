# My Javascript project

My project is a pseudo-shopping website that allows users to buy up to 5 houses of a specific house(family) from the game of thrones series.

## Introduction
We are getting information on some of the houses from a game of thrones api. We use that info to build cards for each house. We then use that info to build a JSON server where we store our data.

## Goals and features
Major Goals for the app are to make everything persists so that even if the site is reloaded, it remembers everything the user already did. The website has a wallet that gives each user a set amount of money to buy each house with and we want our app to remember how much money each user has even after refreshing. We also want our app to remember how many houses a user bought and sold. Each user can only buy up to 5 houses from each house(family) and if a user has 5 houses, they shouldnt be able to buy anymore.

## More deliverables

I want my site to show and remeber how many houses a user has bought. I also want the money in a user's wallet to decrease by the cost of a house when a user buys a house, and increase by the cost of the house when a user sells a house.

Add confirm messaage asking if user wants to buy or sell.
Alert if user can't buy or sell any more houses.
I also want to style the cards with CSS. 



## Completed project
My completed app should have 10 cards with info from the game of thrones api about some houses. It should have a wallet with a set amount of money. It should also have confirm and alert pop ups. Users should be able to buy and sell houses. Website should remember how many houses a user bought and how much money is in a user's wallet.
